\subsection{ARIAC and TRAIL}

TRAIL and the ARIAC research project are part of the regional DigitalWallonia4.ai program, which aims to accelerate the development of artificial intelligence technologies in Wallonia.

TRAIL (TRusted AI Labs) provides actors in the socio-economic landscape with R\&D expertise and AI technological bricks developed by the 5 French-speaking universities and 4 approved research centres active in AI. To achieve this, the SPW-EER has allocated a budget of €32 million for the ARIAC research project led by the TRAIL consortium. This initiative is part of the 4th axis of the regional DigitalWallonia4.ai programme: “Research, innovation and partnerships”.

The ambition is to pool research in artificial intelligence in the Wallonia-Brussels Federation and is concretely reflected through the research project “ARIAC by DigitalWallonia4.ai”, based on an agreement between the Walloon Region (SPW Research) and the actors forming the TRAIL consortium.

The ARIAC project (“Applications and Research for Trusted Artificial Intelligence” in English or “Applications et Recherche pour une Intelligence Artificielle de Confiance” in French) is spread over 6 years and is articulated around 5 WP (Work Package):

\begin{itemize}
    \item human-AI interaction,
    \item trust mechanisms for AI,
    \item model-AI integration,
    \item optimized implementations of AI,
    \item TRAIL Factory.
\end{itemize}
